## Change My E-mail

When sending out e-mails, the HQ system always uses your VATSIM registered e-mail. This is the e-mail you added when you first signed up for VATSIM. You can change your VATSIM registered e-mail any time by visiting this link: [http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php](http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php)

## Membership Help

For general questions or help with your VATSIM account, such as changing any of the information that you originally signed up with, you will need to contact the VATSIM membership department. This link in HQ redirects to the VATSIM membership helpdesk.

## Member List

This page lists all members, resident and visitor, within the HQ system. Clicking on their VATSIM ID on the left column will take you to the member's HQ profile page. You may also filter the table using the search box on the top right.
