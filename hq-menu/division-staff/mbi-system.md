# MBI System

The MBI can be created by a division or vACC staff. A division staff can only create MBIs for their entire division. A vACC staff can create an MBI for their vACC only. The MBI can be restricted to resident or visitor members. The MBI must have a start time but end time is optional as some can be permanent changes.
